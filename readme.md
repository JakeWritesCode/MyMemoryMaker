# Django-boilerplate
A general use boilerplate with all the standard stuff you're probably going to need 
for that next side-project of yours. 

I've been fairly opinionated here and used bootstrap and crispy forms for the front-end.

## Features:

This project has the following features implemented:
 - A really basic front end using bootstrap and django-crispy-forms.
 - An extended user model, with email in place of username.
 - Log-in, log-out, password reset by email.


## Notes:
 - Keys and secrets in the settings file are stored in environment variables from the get
go.
